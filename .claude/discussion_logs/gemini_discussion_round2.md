# Round 2: Implementation Specifics and Code Examples

Based on your excellent analysis, I'd like to dive deeper into specific implementation details:

## 1. OpenTelemetry Implementation

Could you provide a concrete example of how to:
- Configure OpenTelemetry in both Next.js and Hono applications
- Set up the OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar
- Propagate trace context between services
- Add custom spans for cache operations

## 2. Shared Cache Handler for ISR

What's the specific implementation approach for:
- Configuring Next.js to use Redis as shared cache
- Handling cache key conflicts across multiple tasks
- Monitoring cache performance and hit rates

## 3. Zero-Downtime Database Migrations

Can you provide:
- A concrete example of the "expand and contract" pattern
- How to handle schema changes with both old and new app versions running
- Best practices for rollback scenarios

## 4. Performance Optimization

Specific questions:
- What's the optimal Dockerfile structure for minimal image size?
- How to implement SOCI for Fargate?
- Best practices for connection pooling between containers

## 5. Monitoring Implementation

Please provide examples of:
- Custom CloudWatch metrics from the application
- Structured logging format for correlation
- Alert thresholds for each critical metric

I'm particularly interested in production-ready code examples that can be directly implemented.
