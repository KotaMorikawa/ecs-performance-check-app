# ECS Performance Check App - Architecture Discussion with Gemini

## Discussion Date: 2025-01-04

## Summary of Key Recommendations

### 1. AWS ECS Sidecar Pattern Architecture

#### PostgreSQL in ECS vs RDS
- **Critical Issue**: Using EFS for PostgreSQL is a significant performance bottleneck
- **Strong Recommendation**: Migrate to Amazon RDS for production
  - Superior I/O performance with provisioned IOPS
  - Automated backups and high availability (Multi-AZ)
  - Read replicas support
  - The sidecar PostgreSQL is only suitable for development/testing

#### Scaling Strategy
- **Current Limitation**: All containers scale as a single unit
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Decouple database to RDS for independent scaling
  - Consider separate ECS Services for Next.js and Hono if their resource needs differ

#### Security Considerations
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for all credentials
- Run containers as non-root users
- Consider token-based authentication between Next.js and Hono

#### Container Dependencies & Health Checks
```json
// Task Definition Example
{
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "name": "postgres",
    "healthCheck": {
      "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB -h localhost || exit 1"]
    }
  }, {
    "name": "hono",
    "dependsOn": [{
      "containerName": "postgres",
      "condition": "HEALTHY"
    }],
    "healthCheck": {
      "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8000/api/health || exit 1"]
    }
  }, {
    "name": "nextjs",
    "dependsOn": [{
      "containerName": "hono",
      "condition": "HEALTHY"
    }],
    "healthCheck": {
      "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health || exit 1"]
    }
  }]
}
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring Implementation

#### OpenTelemetry Integration
- **Strong Recommendation**: Implement AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry
- Run OpenTelemetry Collector as a sidecar container
- Export metrics to CloudWatch/X-Ray without impacting app performance

#### Distributed Tracing
- Essential for debugging latency across Next.js → Hono → DB
- Propagate trace context headers between services
- Accurately measure container-to-container latency

#### Real-time Metrics Visualization
- For demo: Simple polling mechanism (2-3 second intervals)
- For production: WebSockets for instant updates

#### Metrics Storage
- Start with CloudWatch Metrics (1-second resolution)
- Consider Amazon Timestream for advanced time-series needs

### 3. Caching Strategy and Revalidation

#### Cache Invalidation Chain
1. Hono backend triggers Next.js revalidation
2. Next.js clears internal data cache using `revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath`
3. Serve with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`
4. Trigger CloudFront invalidation for broader updates

#### Secure Revalidation Pattern
```typescript
// Next.js API Route (api/revalidate/route.ts)
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const secret = request.headers.get('x-revalidation-secret');
  
  if (secret !== process.env.REVALIDATE_SECRET) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  
  const { tag, path } = await request.json();
  
  if (tag) {
    revalidateTag(tag);
  } else if (path) {
    revalidatePath(path);
  }
  
  return Response.json({ revalidated: true });
}
```

#### ISR Across Multiple Tasks
- **Critical**: Configure shared cache handler (Redis/ElastiCache)
- Without shared cache, regenerated pages won't be consistent across tasks

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### E2E Testing with Docker Compose
```yaml
# CI/CD Pipeline Stage
e2e-test:
  script:
    - docker-compose up -d
    - ./scripts/wait-for-healthy.sh
    - npx playwright test
    - docker-compose down -v
```

#### Performance Regression Testing
- Integrate k6 load testing in CI
- Define performance budgets (p99 latency < 500ms)
- Fail builds on regression

### 5. Production Readiness

#### Zero-Downtime Deployments
- Use ECS rolling deployment with proper health checks
- Enable ALB connection draining
- Ensure backward-compatible database migrations

#### Critical Infrastructure Changes
1. **Database**: Migrate to RDS Multi-AZ (critical for production)
2. **Secrets**: Use AWS Secrets Manager exclusively
3. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive CloudWatch Dashboard with alerts
4. **Cold Starts**: 
   - Use minimal Docker images (alpine/distroless)
   - Enable SOCI for faster image loading
   - Maintain minimum 1 task to avoid cold starts

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- ALB: 5XX errors, connection errors, response time
- ECS: CPU/Memory utilization, running task count
- Application: Cache hit rate, error rate, API latency
- RDS: CPU, connections, memory, IOPS

## Action Items Priority

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. [ ] Migrate PostgreSQL from EFS to RDS
2. [ ] Implement AWS Secrets Manager
3. [ ] Add proper health check endpoints
4. [ ] Configure container startup dependencies

### Short-term (Medium Priority)
1. [ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
2. [ ] Implement secure revalidation endpoint
3. [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
4. [ ] Optimize Docker images for size

### Long-term (Low Priority)
1. [ ] Implement WebSocket-based real-time metrics
2. [ ] Add performance regression testing with k6
3. [ ] Configure shared cache handler for ISR
4. [ ] Set up staging environment in AWS

## Key Takeaways

1. **PostgreSQL on EFS is not production-ready** - This is the most critical issue
2. **OpenTelemetry is essential** for understanding performance in distributed architecture
3. **Shared cache handler is required** for ISR to work properly across multiple tasks
4. **Security must be built-in** from the start with Secrets Manager and proper IAM roles
5. **Monitoring and alerting** are non-negotiable for production readiness

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis, the recommended approach is to:
1. First focus on the critical infrastructure issues (RDS migration, secrets)
2. Then implement comprehensive monitoring (OpenTelemetry, CloudWatch)
3. Finally optimize performance (caching, Docker images, cold starts)
